the
beginning
of
the
study
of
linguistics,
numerous
attempts
at
defining
what
a
word
is
have
been
made,
with
many
different
criteria.[5]

however,
possible
to
find
consistent
definitions
of
"word"
at
different
levels
of
description.[4]:

definitions
on
the
phonetic
and
phonological
level,
that
it
is
the
smallest
segment
of
sound
that
can
be
theoretically
isolated
by
word
accent
and
boundary
markers;
on
the
orthographic
level
as
a
segment
indicated
by
blank
spaces
in
writing
or
print;
on
the
basis
of
morphology
as
the
basic
element
of
grammatical
paradigms
like
inflection,
different
from
word-forms;
within
semantics
as
the
smallest
and
relatively
independent
carrier
of
meaning
in
a
lexicon;
and
syntactically,
as
the
smallest
permutable
and
substitutable
unit
of
a
sentence.[2]:
some
languages,
these
different
types
of
words
coincide
and
one
can
analyze,
for
example,
a
"phonological
word"
as
essentially
the
same
as
"grammatical
word".
in
other
languages
they
may
correspond
to
elements
of
different
size.[4]:

the
difficulty

from
the
eurocentric
bias,

not
follow

intuitions
of
scholars.
of
the
criteria
developed
for
"word"
can
only
be
applicable
to
languages
of
broadly
synthetic
structure.[4]:
of
this
unclear
status,
some
linguists
propose
avoiding
the
term
"word"
altogether,
instead
focusing
on
better
defined
terms
such
as
morphemes.[6]
